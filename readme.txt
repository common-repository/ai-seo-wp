= How many credits are used on each submission? =
This all depends on how much content is sent to our optimisation services.

= How do I use the service? =
After purchasing credits and configuring the WordPress plugin with your **Subscription ID** and **Secret**. You can then submit your content through the plugin's sidebar, within the Gutenberg editor. The optimised submission will be sent back to your WordPress site by our services, and saved as a new draft revision, on the original content. You can then decide to keep it, modifying it, or optimise further.

The AI optimised submission response may not be perfect on the first try, so you may want to submit the content, make some changes to what you received, and try optimizing again, it's up to you!
